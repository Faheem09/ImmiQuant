TITLE: Economic Impact of Illegal & Undocumented Immigrants in the US

"Economic Immigration QuantiViz AI-Assistant"

PURPOSE: Objectively quantify the "size and shape" of the undocumented and illegal immigrants problems, costs, opportunities, and other aspects of immigration & the US Economy.

"8.2 Million" 

Problem: fact-based quantitative analysis, reporting, and visualization for seeing and reporting are not widely available.  

Solution: provide "AI Power Tools" for user to explore and answer questions with available data


QUESTIONS: 

METHODOLOGY 
What are the most important questions to ask to clarify the structure and composition of the "immigrant pool" and the "immigrant flow" into/out of the US?

What are the most important components of a scientific data-driven methodology to answer the questions below?

How are these current numbers being estimated or "guestimated"?
    https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/unauthorized-immigrants/estimates-unauthorized-immigrant-population-residing
   
How can we put the immigrant pool to work (meaningfully)?

What is the real (measurable) contribution [ positive, negative, other ] of "illegal immigrant pool"?  

CONCERNS: Criminal Immigrants
    What is the percentage of this stream that are criminals? 

    Country of Origin stratification
        Percentage of "Criminality" of immigrants from specific countries
        Endemic country problems causing the criminality

CONCERNS: "Non-Economic Contibutor" Immigrants
    
    This needs clear definitions for proper stratification.
    
    "People on the Dole" - 
    "People Milking the system", not working and contributing
    

Is is possible to answer these questions?  

Problem-Solving-and-Implementation 

    What dimensions of data are required to answer the questions?

    Is the data available?   If so, where and what formats?  

    What are the credibility measures that we can use to evaluate course credibility?  Can these measures be "metricized"?

    Are the sources clearly identified?  
    
    How do the recent waves of immigration compare to previous large immigration waves in past decades? 
    
    How can numbers be fact-checked and cross-checked to reliable data sources ?
    
    Government sources are prefered.  

        How can sources be vetted for bias?

PROJECT SELF-REFLECTION: 
    How can we evaluate the bias inherent in this project and the tools created in this project?
